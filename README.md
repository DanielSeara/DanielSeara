👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Seara (@DanielSeara)
I am an experienced software developer. I have more than 20 years’ experience as a technical instructor, developer, and development consultant. 
I have worked as a software consultant in a wide range of companies in Argentina, Spain, and Peru. I have been asked by Peruvian Microsoft Consulting Services to help more than 5 companies in their migration path to .NET Framework development.
I was Argentina’s Microsoft Regional Director for 4 years and was the first nominated Global Regional Director, a position I held for two years. I also was the manager of the Desarrollador Cinco Estrellas (Five-Star Developer) program, one of the most successful training projects in Latin America. I held a Visual Basic MVP status for more than 10 years, as well as a SharePoint Server MVP status from 2008 until 2014. Additionally, I am the founder and “Dean” of Universidad .NET, the most visited Spanish language site to learn .NET. 
In 2005, I joined Lucient, the leading global company on the Microsoft Data Platform, where he has been working as a trainer, consultant, and mentor.
